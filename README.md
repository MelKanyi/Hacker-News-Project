# Text Classification 
This repository will contain neural network, SVM and Naive Bayes text classification model 

# Introductions
Hacker News is a social news website focusing on computer science and entrepreneurship. It is run by Paul Graham's investment fund and startup incubator, Y Combinator.In general, content that can be submitted is defined as "anything that gratifies one's intellectual curiosity"

# Problem Statement
According to a TechCrunch article: "Graham says that Hacker News gets a lot of complaints that it has a bias toward featuring stories about Y Combinator startups, but he says there is no such bias.With our project, we aim to predict how popular a story will be based on their titles.

# Goal

The goal is to build a text classification model that will predict popularity of a story based on its title.

# Data
